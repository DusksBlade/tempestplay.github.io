			<h3>ACT III </br>
			SCENE 3.</h3>

			<p><i>[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco]</i>

			<dl>

				<dt>GONZALO</dt>
				     <dd>[To ALONSO]</dd>
				<sup id="1">1</sup>    <p>  By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir; </br>
				       My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed </br>
				<sup id="3">3</sup>      Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience, </br>
				       I needs must rest me. </p> </br>

				<dt>ALONSO </dt>
				   <p>   Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
				<sup id="5">5</sup>      Who am myself attach'd with weariness, </br>
				<sup id="6">6</sup>      To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest. </br>
				<sup id="7">7</sup>      Even here I will put off my hope and keep it </br>
				<sup id="8">8</sup>      No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd </br>
				       Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks </br>
				<sup id="10">10</sup>     Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.</br>
					</p>


				<dt>ANTONIO</dt> 
				     <dd>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]</dd>
				      <p>   I am right glad that he's so out of hope. </br>
				<sup id="12">12</sup>     Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose </br>
				       That you resolved to effect.</br>
				        </p> 

				<dt>SEBASTIAN </dt>
				     <dd>[Aside to ANTONIO]</dd>
				       <p>  The next advantage Will we take throughly.
				       	 </p> 

				<dt>ANTONIO </dt>
				     <dd>[Aside to SEBASTIAN] </dd>
				        <p> Let it be to-night; </br>
				<sup id="15">15</sup>     For, now they are oppress'd with travail, they </br>
				       Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance </br>
				       As when they are fresh.</br>
				        </p> 

				<dt>SEBASTIAN </dt>
				     <dd>[Aside to ANTONIO]</dd>
				     <p>  I say, to-night: no more.</p>

			</dl>

				<p><i>Solemn and strange music</i></p>

			<dl>

				<dt>ALONSO </dt>
				     <dd>What harmony is this? My good friends, hark! </dd>

				<dt>GONZALO </dt>
				     <dd>Marvellous sweet music! </dd>

			</dl>

			<p><i>[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; 
			they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King and company
			to eat, they depart]</i></p>

			<dl>

				<dt>ALONSO </dt>
				     <dd><sup id="20">20</sup>     Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these? </dd>

				<dt>SEBASTIAN </dt>
				     <dd><sup id="21">21</sup>     A living drollery. Now I will believe </br>
				       That there are unicorns, that in Arabia </br>
				       There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix </br>
				       At this hour reigning there. </dd>

				<dt>ANTONIO </dt>
				     <dd>I'll believe both; </br>
				<sup id="25">25</sup>     And what does else want credit, come to me, </br>
				<sup id="26">26</sup>     And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did </br>
				       lie, </br>
				       Though fools at home condemn 'em. </dd>

				<dt>GONZALO </dt>
				     <dd>If in Naples </br>
				       I should report this now, would they believe me? </br>
				       If I should say, I saw such islanders-- </br>
				<sup id="30">30</sup>     For, certes, these are people of the island-- </br>
				       Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note, </br>
				<sup id="32">32</sup>     Their manners are more gentle-kind than of </br>
				       Our human generation you shall find </br>
				       Many, nay, almost any. </dd>

				<dt>PROSPERO 
				     <dd>[Aside] Honest lord, </br>
				       Thou hast said well; for some of you there present </br>
				       Are worse than devils. </dd>
